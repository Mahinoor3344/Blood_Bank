**SYSTEM ANALYSIS **


               MySQL: It is an open-source relational database management system 
         (RDBMS). MySQL is the central component of the XAMMP open-source
          Web application software stack. XAMMP is an acronym for "Windows,    
         Apache, MySQL, and Perl/PHP/Python". From source code MySQL 
         can be built and installed manually, but it is always installed from a binary 
         package due to customization. Although further steps are required to alert 
         the security and optimization settings.
